# ESP32-Serial

This demo of the ESP32 shows how it can be used for networking and serial communication. Together, these create a foundation for Internet-of-Things(IoT) projects. Data will be transmitted over a wireless WiFi network from your computer to the ESP32 and then the ESP32 will communicate with an Arduino using serial communication.
